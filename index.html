            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p class="center">I'm Win Pomerantz, a marketer turned aspiring front-end developer. With over seven years
                of
                experience in brand and digital marketing at companies like Charles Schwab, Ubisoft, and eBay, I've
                developed a knack for crafting engaging narratives and user experiences. With a bachelors degree from
                Emory
                University and MBA from UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, I'm currently diving into the world of
                coding through the full-time UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp. I'm
                passionate about blending creativity with technical skills to build captivating web experiences.
                <br></br>
                Join me as I transition from marketing to coding and explore the exciting intersection of art and
                technology.

                    <p>Before beginning the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp, all students were assigned a prework project to
                        build a course study guide website from scratch. Using the resources given to me, this project
                        led to the first site I ever built from scratch.</p>

                    <p>In our first big solo project in our Coding Bootcamp, we were tasked with refactoring the code of
                        a poorly designed website. Here I learned how to make code simpler and more efficient, and more
                        easily understood by human readers through the use of semantic HTML elements.</p>

                    <p>Who could forget. It's pretty great, right? A pretty custom logo, a nice header, clickable
                        images, a contact form. This is with only one week. <br></br> I'm just getting going!</p>
